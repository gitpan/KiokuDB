0.10
    - Load classes in the typemap resolution code, so that objects whose
      classes aren't necessarily loaded at compile time can still be inflated.
    - add 'import_yaml' to KiokuDB::Util
    - Refactor parts of the JSPON file backend into a JSON serialization role
    - Don't load thunks when updating partially loaded objects
    - No longer dies if txn_do is used but the backend doesn't supports it
      (implicit noop)
    - Add a new role and test for nested transaction supporting backends
      (partial rollback)

0.06
