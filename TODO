    * BDB/DBI
        * Set::Object/Hash sharding
    * RDF
        * generate triples
            * predicates as FQ attr names names
            * predicates as short attr names
            * predicates as UUIDs?
            * no collapsing by default
        * SPARQL matching with simple search
    * Backend::Locking
        * exclusive write lock TXNs using deferred writes

* typemap
    * runtime role support
        * hashref in new 'meta' field
        * what about DB resident metaclass? like a smalltalk image
	* class version upgrade path as part of class field

* tools
    * generic garbage collector? 'root' isn't really that accurate.. think of a better way
