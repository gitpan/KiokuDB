=head1 NAME

KiokuDB::Scope - 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    {
        my $scope = $dir->new_scope;

        ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Live object scopes exist in order to ensure objects don't die too soon if the
only other references to them are weak.

When scopes are destroyed the refcounts of the objects they refer to go down,
and the parent scope is replaced in the live object set.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item push

Adds objects or entries, increasing their reference count.

=item clear

Clears the objects from the scope object.
