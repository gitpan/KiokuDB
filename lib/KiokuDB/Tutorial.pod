=head1 NAME

KiokuDB::Tutorial - Getting started with L<KiokuDB>

=head1 INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install L<KiokuDB> and a number of backends is
L<Task::KiokuDB>.

L<KiokuDB> depends on L<Moose> and a few other modules out of the box, but no
specific storage module.

L<KiokuDB> is a frontend to several backends, much like L<DBI> uses DBDs to
connect to actual databases.

For development and testing you can use the L<KiokuDB::Backend::Hash> backend,
which is an in memory store, but for production L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB> or
L<KiokuDB::Backend::DBI> are the recommended backends.

See below for instructions on getting L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB> installed.

=head1 CREATING A DIRECTORY

A KiokuDB directory is the object that contains all the common functionality
regardless of the backend.

The simplest directory ready for use can be created like this:

    my $dir = KiokuDB->new(
        backend => KiokuDB::Backend::Hash->new
    );

We will revisit other more interesting backend configuration later in this
document, but for now this will do.

You can also use DSN strings to connect to the various backends:

    KiokuDB->connect("hash");

    KiokuDB->connect("dbi:SQLite:dbname=foo", create => 1);

    KiokuDB->connect("bdb:dir=foo", create => 1);

=head1 INSERTING OBJECTS

Let's start with this simple class:

    package Person;
    use Moose;

    has name => (
        isa => "Str",
        is  => "rw",
    );

We can instantiate it:

    my $obj = Person->new( name => "Homer Simpson" );

and insert the object to the database as follows:

    my $scope = $dir->new_scope;

    my $homer_id = $dir->store($obj);

This is very trivial use of L<KiokuDB>, but it illustrates a few important
things.

First, no schema is necessary. L<KiokuDB> can use L<Moose> to introspect your
object without needing to predefine anything like tables.

Second, every object in the database has an ID. If you don't choose an ID for
an object, L<KiokuDB> will assign a UUID instead. The ID is like a primary key
in a relational database. If you want to choose an ID for your object, you can
do something like:

    $dir->store( homer => $obj );

and C<$obj>'s ID will be C<homer>. If you don't provide an ID a UUID will be
assigned automatically.

Third, all L<KiokuDB> operations need to be performed within a B<scope>. The
scope does not apply to a simple example like the above, but becomes necessary
once weak references are used. We will look into that in more detail later.

=head1 LOADING OBJECTS

So now that Homer has been inserted into the database, we can fetch him out of
there using the ID we got from C<store>.

    my $homer = $dir->lookup($homer_id);

Assuming that C<$scope> and C<$obj> are still in scope, C<$homer> and C<$obj>
will actually be the same reference:

    refaddr($homer) == refaddr($obj)

This is because L<KiokuDB> tracks which objects are "live" in the
B<live object set> (L<KiokuDB::LiveObjects>).

If C<$obj> and C<$scope> are no longer in scope you'd need to create a new
scope, and then fetch the object from the database again:

    my $scope = $dir->new_scope;

    my $homer = $dir->lookup($homer_id);

In this case since the original instance of Homer is no longer live, but has
been garbage collected by Perl, L<KiokuDB> will fetch it from the backend.

=head1 OBJECT RELATIONSHIPS

Let's extend the C<Person> class to hold some more interesting data than just a
C<name>:

    package Person;

    has spouse => (
        isa => __PACKAGE__,
        is  => "rw",
        weak_ref => 1,
    );

This new C<spouse> attribute will hold a reference to another person object.

Let's first create and insert another object:

    my $marge_id = $dir->store(
        Person->new( name => "Marge Simpson" ),
    );

Now that we have both objects in the database, lets link them together:

    {
        my $scope = $dir->new_scope;

        my ( $marge, $homer ) = $dir->lookup( $marge_id, $homer_id );

        $marge->spouse($homer);
        $homer->spouse($marge);

        $dir->store( $marge, $homer );
    }

Now we have created a persistent B<object graph>, that is several objects which
point to each other.

The reason C<spouse> was had the C<weak_ref> option was so that this circular
structure will not leak.

When then objects are updated in the database L<KiokuDB> sees that their
C<spouse> attribute contains references, and this relationship will be encoded
using their unique ID in storage.

To load the graph, we can do something like this:

    {
        my $scope = $dir->new_scope;

        my $homer = $dir->lookup($homer_id);

        print $homer->spouse->name; # Marge Simpson
    }

    {
        my $scope = $dir->new_scope;

        my $marge = $dir->lookup($marge_id);

        print $marge->spouse->name; # Homer Simpson

        refaddr($marge) == refaddr($marge->spouse->spouse); # true
    }

When L<KiokuDB> is loading the initial object, all the objects the object
depends on will also be loaded. The C<spouse> attribute contains a
reference to another object (by ID), and this link is resolved at inflation
time.

=head2 The purpose of C<new_scope>

This is where C<new_scope> becomes important. As objects are inflated from the
database, they are pushed onto the live object scope, in order to increase
their reference count.

If this was not done, by the time C<$homer> was returned from C<lookup> his
C<spouse> attribute would have been cleared because there is no other reference
to Marge.

If, on the other hand the circular structure was not weak it would have to be
broken manually, which is very error prone.

By using this idiom:

    {
        my $scope = $dir->new_scope;

        # do all KiokuDB work in here
    }

You are ensuring that the objects live at least as long as is necessary.

In a web application context usually you create one new scope per request.

While scopes can nest, this is not a requirement.

You are free to create as many or as few scopes as you like, as long as there
is at least one, but note that child scopes refer to their parents to ensure
that all objects that were already live at the time that a scope is created are
still alive

=head1 OBJECT SETS

More complex relationships (not necessarily 1 to 1) are fairly easy to model
with L<Set::Object>.

Let's extend the C<Person> class to add such a relationship:

    package Person;

    has children => (
        does => "KiokuDB::Set",
        is   => "rw",
    );

L<KiokuDB::Set> objects are L<KiokuDB> specific wrappers for L<Set::Object>.

    my @kids = map { Person->new( name => $_ ) } qw(maggie lisa bart);

    use KiokuDB::Util qw(set);

    my $set = set(@kids);

    $homer->children($set);

    $dir->store($homer);

The C<set> convenience function creates a new L<KiokuDB::Set::Transient>
object. A transient set is one which started its life in memory space.

The C<weak_set> convenience function also exists, creating a transient set with
L<Set::Object::Weak> used internally to help avoid circular structures (for
instance if setting a C<parent> attribute in our example).

The set object behaves pretty much like a normal L<Set::Object>:

    my @kids = $dir->lookup($homer_id)->children->members;

The main difference is that sets coming from the database are deferred by
default, that is the objects in C<@kids> are not loaded until they are actually
needed.

This allows large object graphs to exist in the database, while only being
partially loaded, without breaking the encapsulation of user objects. This
behavior is implemented in L<KiokuDB::Set::Deferred> and
L<KiokuDB::Set::Loaded>.

This set object is optimized to make most operations defer loading. For
instance, if you intersect two deferred sets, only the members of the
intersection set will need to be loaded.

=head1 THE TYPEMAP

Storing an object with L<KiokuDB> involves passing it to L<KiokuDB::Collapser>,
the object that "flattens" objects into L<KiokuDB::Entry> before the entries
are inserted into the backend.

The collapser uses a L<KiokuDB::TypeMap> object that tells it how objects of
each type should be collapsed.

During retrieval of objects the same typemap is used to reinflate objects back
into working objects.

Trying to store an object that is not in the typemap is an error. The reason
behind this is that many objects depend on runtime states (for instance C<DBI>
handles need a socket, objects based on XS modules have an internal pointer as
an integer), and even though the majority of objects are safe to serialize,
even a small bit of unreported fragility is usually enough to create large,
hard to debug problems.

An exception to this rule is L<Moose> based objects, because they have
sufficient meta information available through L<Moose>'s powerful reflection
support in order to be safely serialized.

Additionally, the standard backends provide a default typemap for common
objects (L<DateTime>, L<Path::Class>, etc), which by default is merged with any
custom typemap you pass to L<KiokuDB>.

So, in order to actually get L<KiokuDB> to store things like L<Class::Accessor>
based objects, you can do something like this:

    my $dir = KiokuDB->new(
        backend => $backend,
        typemap => KiokuDB::TypeMap->new(
            entries => {
                "My::Object" => KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Naive->new,
            },
        ),
    );

L<KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Naive> is a type map entry that performs naive
collapsing of the object, by simply walking it recursively.

When the collapser encounters an object it will ask
L<KiokuDB::TypeMap::Resolver> for a collapsing routine based on the class of
the object.

This lookup is typically performed by C<ref $object>, not using inheritence,
because a typemap entry that is safe to use with a superclass isn't necessarily
safe to use with a subclass. If you B<do> want inherited entries, specify
C<isa_entries>:

    KiokuDB::TypeMap->new(
        isa_entries => {
            "My::Object" => KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Naive->new,
        },
    );

If no normal (C<ref> keyed) entry is found for an object, the isa entries are
searched for a superclass of that object. Subclass entries are tried before
superclass entries. The result of this lookup is cached, so it only happens
once per class.

=head2 Typemap Entries

If you want to do custom serialization hooks, you can specify hooks to collapse
your object:

    KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Callback->new(
        collapse => sub {
            my $object = shift;

            ...

            return @some_args;
        },
        expand => sub {
            my ( $class, @some_args ) = @_;

            ...

            return $object;
        },
    );

These hooks are called as methods on the object to be collapsed.

For instance the L<Path::Class> related typemap ISA entry is:

    'Path::Class::Entity' => KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Callback->new(
        intrinsic => 1,
        collapse  => "stringify",
        expand    => "new",
    );

The C<intrinsic> flag is discussed in the next section.

Another option for typemap entries is L<KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::Passthrough>,
which is appropriate when you know the backend's serialization can handle that
data type natively.

For example, if your object has a L<Storable> hook which you know is
appropriate (e.g. contains no sub objects that need to be collapsible) and your
backend uses L<KiokuDB::Backend::Serialize::Storable>. L<DateTime> is an
example of a class with such storable hopes:

    'DateTime' => KiokuDB::Backend::Entry::Passthrough->new( intrinsic => 1 )

=head2 Intrinsic vs. First Class

In L<KiokuDB> every object is normally assigned an ID, and if the object is
shared by several objects this relationship will be preserved.

However, for some objects this is not the desired behavior. These are objects
that represent values, like L<DateTime>, L<Path::Class> entries, L<URI>
objects, etc.

L<KiokuDB> can be asked to collapse such objects B<intrinsicly>, that is
instead of creating a new L<KiokuDB::Entry> with its own ID for the object, the
object gets collapsed directly into its parent's structures.

This means that shared references that are collapsed intrinsically will be
loaded back from the database as two distinct copies, so updates to one will
not affect the other.

For instance, when we run the following code:

    use Path::Class;

    my $path = file(qw(path to foo));

    $obj_1->file($path);

    $obj_2->file($path);

    $dir->store( $obj_1, $obj_2 );

Then

    refaddr($obj_1->file) == refaddr($obj_2->file)

holds true when inserting, but is no longer the case after C<$obj_1> and
C<$obj_2> are reloaded from the database.

This behavior is usually more appropriate for objects that aren't mutated, but
are instead cloned and replaced, and for which creating a first class entry in
the backend with its own ID is undesired.

=head2 The Default Typemap

Each backend comes with a default typemap, with some built in entries for
common CPAN modules' objects. L<KiokuDB::TypeMap::Default> contains more
details.

=head1 SIMPLE SEARCHES

Most backends support an inefficient but convenient simple search, which scans
the entries and matches fields.

If you want to make use of this API we suggest using L<KiokuDB::Backend::DBI>
since simple searching is implemented using an SQL where clause, which is much
more efficient (you do have to set up the column manually though).

Calling the C<search> method with a hash reference as the only argument invokes
the simple search functionality, returning a L<Data::Stream::Bulk> with the
results:

    my $stream = $dir->search({ name => "Homer Simpson" });

    while ( my $block = $stream->next ) {
        foreach my $object ( @$block ) {
            # $object->name eq "Homer Simpson"
       }
    }

This exact API is intentionally vague. In the future it will be compatible with
L<DBIx::Class> 0.09's syntax.

=head1 GETTING STARTED WITH BDB

So far we've only made use of L<KiokuDB::Backend::Hash>, so while our objects
were serialized, they were not actually stored on disk.

The most mature backend for L<KiokuDB> is L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB>. It performs
very well, and supports many features, like L<Search::GIN> integration to
provide customized indexing of your objects and transactions.

L<KiokuDB::Backend::DBI> is newer and not as test, but also supports
transactions and L<Search::GIN> based queries. It performs well too, though not
as fast as L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB>, and is easier to install (all you need is
your DBD).

=head2 Installing L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB>

L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB> needs the L<BerkeleyDB> module, and a recent version
of Berkeley DB itself, which can be found here:
L<http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/db/index.html>.

BerkeleyDB (the library) normally installs into C</usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.7>,
while L<BerkeleyDB> (the module) looks for it in C</usr/local/BerkeleyDB>, so
adding a symbolic link should make installation easy.

Once you have L<BerkeleyDB> installed, L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB> should install
without problem and you can use it with L<KiokuDB>.

=head2 Using L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB>

To use the BDB backend we must first create the storage. To do this the
C<create> flag must be passed:

    my $backend = KiokuDB::Backend::BDB->new(
        manager => {
            home   => Path::Class::Dir->new(qw(path to storage)),
            create => 1,
        },
    );

The BDB backend uses L<BerkeleyDB::Manager> to do a lot of the L<BerkeleyDB>
gruntwork. The L<BerkeleyDB::Manager> object will be instantiated using the
arguments provided in the C<manager> attribute.

Now that the storage is created we can make use of this backend, much like before:

    my $dir = KiokuDB->new( backend => $backend );

Subsequent opens will not required the C<create> argument to be true, but it
doesn't hurt.

As a convenience feature, L<KiokuDB> provides the C<connect> method. The above
code could be written more concisely as:

    my $dir = KiokuDB->connect( "bdb:dir=path/to/storage", create => 1 );

=head1 TRANSACTIONS

Some backends (ones which do the L<KiokuDB::Backend::Role::TXN> role) can be used
with transactions.

If you are familiar with L<DBIx::Class> this should be very familiar:

    $dir->txn_do(sub {
        $dir->store($obj);
    });

This will create a L<BerkeleyDB> level transaction, and all changes to the
database are committed if the block was executed cleanly.

If any error occurred the transaction will be rolled back, and the changes will
not be visible to subsequent reads.

Note that L<KiokuDB> does B<not> touch live instances, so if you do something like

    $dir->txn_do(sub {
        my $scope = $dir->new_scope;
        $obj->name("Dancing Hippy");
        $dir->store($obj);
    });

the C<name> attribute is B<not> rolled back, it is simply the C<store>
operation that gets reverted.

Transactions will nest properly, and with BDB they generally increase write
performance.

=head1 QUERIES

L<KiokuDB:Backend::BDB::GIN> is a subclass of L<KiokuDB::Backend::BDB> that
provides L<Search::GIN> integration.

L<Search::GIN> is a framework to index and query objects, inspired by Postgres'
internal GIN api. GIN stands for Generalized Inverted Indexes.

Using L<Search::GIN> arbitrary search keys can be indexed for your objects, and
these objects can then be looked up using queries.

For instance, one of the pre canned searches L<Search::GIN> supports out of the
box is class indexing. Let's use L<Search::GIN::Extract::Class> to do class
lookups, as is commonly expected of OODBMSs:

    my $dir = KiokuDB->new(
        backend => KiokuDB::Backend::BDB::GIN->new(
            extract => Search::GIN::Extract::Class->new,
        ),
    );

    $dir->store( @random_objects );

To look up the objects, we use the corresponding query:

    my $query = Search::GIN::Query::Class->new(
        isa => "Person", # find any object that ->isa("Person")
    );

    my $stream = $dir->search($query);

The result is L<Data::Stream::Bulk> object that represents the search results.
It can be iterated as follows:

    while ( my $block = $stream->next ) {
        foreach my $person ( @$block ) {
            print "found a preson: ", $person->name;
        }
    }

Or even more simply, if you don't mind loading the whole resultset into memory:

    my @people = $stream->all;

The way it works internally that L<Search::GIN::Extract::Class> introspects the
objects as they are being inserted to the database, and extracts all the keys
that L<Search::GIN::Query::Class> would need to later find these objects in the
lookup. This process can be heavily customized and supports far more
functionality than simple queries like the above. See L<Search::GIN> for more
details.

The most commonly used L<Search::GIN> extractor and query pair is
L<Search::GIN::Extract::Callback> and L<Search::GIN::Query::Manual>, which
allow you to generate custom keys and query on these keys by hand.
